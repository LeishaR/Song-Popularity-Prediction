# Song-Popularity-Prediction
In today’s music world, numerous songs are composed and released daily. Musicians, record labels, and streaming platforms can benefit significantly from a reliable model that can predict a song's likelihood of success. In this study, we present a methodology for popularity estimation. We utilized a diverse dataset from Spotify, a prominent music streaming platform, to establish the “Proxy Popularity Score” for precise popularity prediction. This study utilizes three models: Random Forest, LightGBM Regressor and XGBoost Regressor. The Proposed model employs performance metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared error to evaluate the model's performance in predicting song popularity. High correlation values of 99.85%, 99.87%, and 99.84% were observed for the XGBoost Regressor, LightGBM Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, respectively. At the end of our study, we put the models to the test by ranking songs based on the predicted popularity scores.
